# How to get started

1. Install the program by running `git clone https://github.com/Duerme/VALSCII.git` in a terminal or you can just install it a a zip in the top right.
   
2. You have two ways of running the program
   
   i. Compiling using python

     - If you want to use Python to compile the program, you will need to install the following dependencies: `customtkinter` & `tkinter`
     - Run main.py when dependencies have been installed
   
   ii. Running the exe

     - Inside of the `dist/main/' directory you will see an exe. Run that one and the program should start.
     - If Windows warns you from running the program just click "run anyway". You can upload the file to www.virustotal.com if you are worried it is a virus.

  Enjoy!
